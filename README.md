<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Memotion 2 is the 2nd iteration of the  <a href='http://www.amitavadas.com/Memotion.html'>Memotion task </a> which was conducted at Semeval 2020. The challenge consists of three subtasks:
Sentiment (positive, negative, and neutral) analysis of memes
Overall emotion (humor, sarcasm, offensive, and motivational) classification of memes
Classifying the intensity of meme emotions.
We have released annotated data of memes (images and the embedded text)</p>
<p>Information on social media comprises of various modalities such as textual, visual and audio. NLP
and Computer Vision communities often leverage only one prominent modality in isolation to study
social media. However, computational processing of Internet memes needs a hybrid approach. The
growing ubiquity of Internet memes on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and
Twitter further suggests that we can not ignore such multimodal content anymore. To the best of our
knowledge, there is not much attention towards meme emotion analysis. The objective of this proposal is to bring the attention of the research community towards the automatic processing of Internet
memes.</p>

<p>The task Memotion analysis released approx 10K annotated memes- with human annotated
labels namely sentiment(positive, negative, neutral), type of emotion(sarcastic,funny,offensive, motivation) and their corresponding intensity. The challenge consisted of three subtasks: sentiment
(positive, negative, and neutral) analysis of memes, overall emotion (humor, sarcasm, offensive, and
motivational) classification of memes, and classifying intensity of meme emotion. The best performances achieved were F1 (macro average) scores of 0.35, 0.51 and 0.32, respectively for each of the
three subtasks</p>
